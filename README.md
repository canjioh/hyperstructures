# Hyperstructures
We want to find a non-Desargues finite geometry in order to provide the **K**-vetor space associated with a hyperfield multiplicative operation. See Remark 3.12 in the manuscript "[The hyperring of adèle classes](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022314X10002180)" by Alain Connes and Caterina Consani.

To do that, we want to find a number $n>8$, for which $(x,y)\to(x-y)$ is a bijection between $F_p\times F_p$ and $F_p$ (actually we should exclude the diagonal and the zero element respectively).

The prime $p$ is subject to the condition $p=n^2+n+1$.

It is well known that such a bijection can be realized for $n={1,2,8}$.

Conjecture: such a bijection exists only for $n={1,2,8}$.

We provide the outputs for $n=1000$ and $n=2000$.

This study is related to the problem of finding a non-quotient Krasner hyperfield extension of **K**, see the paper "[The hyperring of adèle classes](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022314X10002180)" by Alain Connes and Caterina Consani quoted above.

This is part of a joint project run by Nicolò Cangiotti and Alessandro Linzi.
